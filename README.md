**Smart Pill Dispenser – Revolutionizing Medication Management**

We are team ADADA!

Our Smart Pill Dispenser introduces a groundbreaking approach to medication adherence by integrating motion sensor technology with automated pill dispensing. Unlike traditional pill organizers or smart reminders, our device automatically dispenses the correct dosage of multiple medications when a patient waves their hand under the sensor—eliminating the need for manual sorting or reliance on alarms.

### **What sets us apart?**

- **Hands-free, touchless operation** – ideal for elderly patients or individuals with limited dexterity (e.g., arthritis, Parkinson’s).
- **Customizable prescription schedules** – syncs with a mobile app to adjust dosages in real-time.
- **Error-proof dispensing** – reduces the risk of **overdosing or missing doses**, a common issue in medication non-adherence.
- **AI-powered reminders & analytics** – tracks patient adherence and alerts caregivers or doctors if doses are skipped.

By incorporating **IoT connectivity, insight-driven alerts, and a sleek, ergonomic design**, our solution **redefines medication management** with unparalleled creativity and originality.
